# Data Professionals Survey Analytics Using Power BI

## Data Visualization Project: Data Professional Survey Breakdown

* Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing survey data from 500+ data professionals, focusing on job titles, salaries, programming preferences, and demographics.
- Transformed raw survey data using Power Query, removing irrelevant columns, splitting job titles and programming languages by delimiters, and standardizing salary ranges into decimal values.
- Engineered a custom column to calculate average salaries from ranges (e.g., converting "100K-150K" to numerical averages), handling edge cases like "225+" for high earners.
- Designed and iterated visualizations including stacked bar charts (average salary by job title), tree maps (country distribution), and gauges (work-life balance satisfaction) to reveal actionable insights.
- Enhanced data accuracy by adjusting data types (text to decimal) and streamlining demographic fields like country into "other" categories for cleaner analysis.
- Finalized a cohesive dashboard titled "Data Professional Survey Breakdown," customizing themes, refining layouts, and optimizing titles for clarity and visual appeal.
